    <h1>Simple Steps to Make &amp; Distribute Medical Face Shields Page</h1>
    <p>In response to the Covid-19 Pandemic, makers the world over have responded in a tremendous way by 
      designing and making various items that are sorely needed by the medical community but are in a very limited supply. 
      One of these items is Face Shields.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I wanted to make the process of figuring out what to do, and doing it, as simple as possible, so that I
      myself (as well as you too) could quickly see and understand what steps I need to take to make these face
      shields and get them to organizations that need them.
      So I put together this little web site!
    </p>
      
      <p><a href="http://www.erikcederberg.se" target="erik">Erik Cederburg</a> has done an amazing work by creating
      lots of different options and versions for face shield frames, templates, files to be used 
      with laser cutters to cut holes in the clear plastic sheets, etc. and placed them on-line for download.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is really great to have all of these options, but...<br>
      it is a bit overwhelming. I wanted to print the 8 peg face shield frame Joel<sup>2</sup> made in his YouTube video. 
      It was really hard for me to find it! I <i>did</i> find it at last and download it by the way.
      Thankfully, a little later after that, the directory structure was re-organized and it became easier to find stuff
      in their repo<sup>3</sup>.
    </p>
      
      <p>I wanted to focus in on just <i>one</i> STL file to print on a 3D printer, and using a low-tech single hole punch tool
      to put the holes in the clear plastic sheets for the shield. For those of us who have 3D Printers, not all
      of us have laser cutters! ðŸ˜œ  I know that I don't!

            <ol>
              <p>To print the <i>Face Shield frames</i> you will need:</p>
              
              <li>You will need to have at least one working 3D printer. ðŸ˜Š</li>
              <li>You will need to have some filament to print with. PLA works, but PETG is better if you 
                  can swing it!</li>
              <li>You will need to download the STL file (<a href="./faceShieldFrame8Peg.stl">faceShieldFrame8Peg.stl</a><sup>1</sup>) 
                for the Face Shield frame... which you can
                do <a href="./faceShieldFrame8Peg.stl">here</a><sup>1</sup>! 
                <br>See <i>Step 2</i> for the </li>
             </ol>
             <ol>
               <p>To make the clear plasic shields themselves that attach to the Face Shield frames you will
                 need to:
                 <li><i>Have</i> the clear plastic shields! <br>
                 I bought mine at Office Depot. They appear to be the same kind that Joel Telling 
                 (3D Printing Nerd)  used to make his face shields.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Step 2: Printing the Face Shield Frame</h4>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li><h3>Distributing Them</h3>
        <p>Of course these face shields are of little use if you can't get them to the people who need
        to use them! You don't want a box of them just sitting in your basement collecting dust!</p>
        <p>Below is a list of options you can explore...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact your local municipality and ask them if they have a need for these kind of shields.
          </li>
          <li>Contact local hospitals.</li>
          <li>Do you personally know people who would benefit from these shields? Doctors, nurses, people who have to 
            work around others (one example that comes to mind is someone working a cash register at a store). 
            Contact these people.</li>
          <li>If any of the above options seems a bit much for you, Matterhackers has set up a special web page
            (<a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/covid-19" target="mth">https://www.matterhackers.com/covid-19</a>)
            to help get to people who need the face shields to get them from the people (perhaps you?) who
            have <i>made</i> the face shields!
          </li>

      <sup>1</sup> <small>I got this file from the:
      <a href="https://github.com/Cederb/Faceshield.nu/tree/master/Sweden/3D%20Printing%20Files%20(STL)" target="cederbFaceshield">Cederb / Faceshield.nu / Sweden</a> site on Github and renamed it to this shorter name
    and saved it <i>here</i> in this Github Repo.</small>

    <small>Joel Telling runs the YouTube channel 3D Printing Nerd. He put out 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHDMdyN5Jjs&t=2s" target="vid">this video</a> talking all 
      about making these face shields and encourage us viewers who
      are able, to make some and get them to the folks who <i>need</i> them. In the video he 
    gives one to a nurse friend who tries it out on a shift working in the E.R. and found that it worked great!
    Some of her collegues wanted their own too!</small>
    <br>
    <sup>3</sup> 
    <small>For those of you who know 3D Printing, but have never used Github, a <i>repo</i> (short for
    'repository' is a place to put files and handle their different versions.</small>
