    <h1>Face Shield Info Page</h1>
    
    <p>
      I wanted to make the process of figuring out what to do, and doing it, as simple as possible, so I
      put together this little web site.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Overview</h3>
      </li>
    
      <li><h3>Making the Face Shields</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><h4>Step 1: The Obvious Stuff</h4>
            
            <ol>
              <p>To print the Face Shield frames you will need:</p>
              
              <li>You will need to have at least one working 3D printer. ðŸ˜Š</li>
              <li>You will need to have some filament to print with. PLA works, but PETG is better if you 
                  can swing it!</li>
              <li>You will need to download the STL file (<a href="./faceShieldFrame8Peg.stl">faceShieldFrame8Peg.stl</a><super>1</super>) for the Face Sheild frame... which you can
                do <a href="./faceShieldFrame8Peg.stl">here</a><super>1</super>! See <i>Step 2</i> for the </li>
             </ol>
             <ol>
               <p>To make the clear plasic shields themselves that attach to the Face Shield frames you will
                 need to:
                 <li>dddd</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Step 2</h4>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li><h3>Distributing Them</h3>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <super>1</super> I got this file from the xxxxx site on Github and renamed it to this shorter name.
