    <h1>Face Shield Info Page</h1>
    <p>In response to the Covid-19 Pandemic, makers the world over have responded in a tremendous way by 
      designing and making various items that are sorely needed by the medical community but are in limited supply. 
      One of these items is Face Shields.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I wanted to make the process of figuring out what to do, and doing it, as simple as possible, so I
      put together this little web site.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Overview</h3>
      </li>
    
      <li><h3>Making the Face Shields</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><h4>Step 1: The Obvious Stuff</h4>
            
            <ol>
              <p>To print the <i>Face Shield frames</i> you will need:</p>
              
              <li>You will need to have at least one working 3D printer. ðŸ˜Š</li>
              <li>You will need to have some filament to print with. PLA works, but PETG is better if you 
                  can swing it!</li>
              <li>You will need to download the STL file (<a href="./faceShieldFrame8Peg.stl">faceShieldFrame8Peg.stl</a><sup>1</sup>) 
                for the Face Shield frame... which you can
                do <a href="./faceShieldFrame8Peg.stl">here</a><sup>1</sup>! 
                <br>See <i>Step 2</i> for the </li>
             </ol>
             <ol>
               <p>To make the clear plasic shields themselves that attach to the Face Shield frames you will
                 need to:
                 <li><i>Have</i> the clear plastic shields! <br>
                 I bought mine at Office Depot. They appear to be the same kind that Joel Telling 
                 (3D Printing Nerd)  used to make his face shields.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Step 2: Printing the Face Shield Frame</h4>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li><h3>Distributing Them</h3>
        <p>Of course these face shields are of little use if you can't get them to the people who need
        to use them! You don't want a box of them just sitting in your basement collecting dust!</p>
        <p>Below is a list of options you can explore...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact your local municipality and ask them if they have a need for these kind of shields.
          </li>
          <li>Contact local hospitals.</li>
          <li>Do you personally know people who would benefit from these shields? Doctors, nurses, people who have to 
            work around others (one example that comes to mind is someone working a cash register at a store). 
            Contact these people.</li>
          <li>If any of the above options seems a bit much for you, Matterhackers has set up a special web page
            to help get to people who need the face shields to get them from the people (perhaps you?) who
            have <i>made</i> the face shields!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <sup>1</sup> <small>I got this file from the:
      <a href="https://github.com/Cederb/Faceshield.nu/tree/master/Sweden/3D%20Printing%20Files%20(STL)" target="cederbFaceshield">Cederb / Faceshield.nu / Sweden</a> site on Github and renamed it to this shorter name
    and saved it <i>here</i> in this Github Repo.</small>
